-	Add frame interval parameter to Actor::Update()?
		This could give different speeds for different actors, and would remove hardcoding
		what does this mean? I've forgotton, probably not important then.
-	Decide if I should use "frames per second" or "millisecond intervals" for sprite animations
		it's fine how it is for now
-	Should I set the frame index inside Actor::Update()?
		no, it's fine in the draw funcion

-	Should "Sprite" be an independant module from actor?
		It could include the image & animation class; essentially a wrapper
		no, since the "sprite" and the bounding box are to tightly connected, abstracting this away
		 would only cause problems.
