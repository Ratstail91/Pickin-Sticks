Sprite Sheet, from Image:
	has a frame count
	has a frame index
	has a frame delay (interval, 0 means don't animate)
	has an active value

	disallow clip manipulation
	disallow Image::LoadSurface() & Image::SetSurface(), replace with custom versions w/ parameters

	Explicit width & height when loading/setting

Animator has no concept of sprite sheets, it's purely a number crunching class.
